# Sub-domain search 

This program allows you to find the sub-domains associated with a website.

### I've created this program to show just how easy this search can be. Too many developers neglect the security of their sub-domains, which are the gateways to an attack.

## How does it work ?

There are many word lists associated with potential subdomain names. By retrieving these lists, available with a simple Google search, the program will compare and record the sub-domains found in a file.
From there, an attacker can check subdomains and identify vulnerabilities to prepare an attack.

## A few protection tips 
- Continuous monitoring: use monitoring tools to track the emergence of new sub-domains and monitor changes in your online infrastructure
- SSL/TLS certificate management: Ensure that all your sub-domains are protected by SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt communications between users and your site. This helps prevent interception attacks.
- Regular updates: Ensure that all software, web servers, databases and other components of your infrastructure are regularly updated with the latest security patches.
- Using firewalls: Configure a firewall to filter incoming and outgoing traffic, implementing strict rules to limit potential vulnerabilities.
- Access management: Restrict access to control panels, servers and other critical elements of your infrastructure. Use strong credentials and implement two-factor authentication where possible.
- Securing sub-domains: Apply the same security measures to your sub-domains as to your main domain. Ensure that sub-domains have no vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise overall security.
- Log monitoring: Set up log monitoring to detect any suspicious or unauthorized activity. This can help you quickly identify a potential intrusion.
- Possibility of not publicly disclosing all sub-domains: Avoid publishing a complete list of your sub-domains on your website or in public resources. This can make it more difficult for attackers to discover them.
- Password protection: Protect access to subdomains with strong passwords or two-factor authentication. This can limit unauthorized access even if subdomains are discovered.
